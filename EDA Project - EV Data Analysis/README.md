## Overview:
The Electric Vehicle (EV) Dataset provides a rich set of information related to electric vehicles, covering a wide range of attributes including geographic location, vehicle specifications, and eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) benefits. It contains detailed data such as vehicle identification numbers (VIN), registration locations, electric vehicle types, driving range, and the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP).

## Dataset Contents:
1. VIN: Unique vehicle identification number.
2. County, City, State: Geographic location of the vehicle.
3. Postal Code: Locationâ€™s postal code.
4. Model Year: Year the vehicle was manufactured.
5. Make and Model: Manufacturer and specific model details.
6. Electric Vehicle Type: Type of EV (e.g., BEV, PHEV).
7. CAFV Eligibility: Eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle benefits.
8. Electric Range: Distance the vehicle can travel on electric power (in miles).
9. Base MSRP: Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.
10. Legislative District: Political district of vehicle registration.
11. DOL Vehicle ID: Unique ID from the Department of Licensing.
12. Vehicle Location: Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
13. Electric Utility: Electric utility provider.
14. 2020 Census Tract: Geographic area based on U.S. Census data.

## Objective of the Project:
The primary aim is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), both univariate and bivariate, on the dataset to:
* Understand individual variable distributions such as electric vehicle range, MSRP, and geographic trends.
* Identify outliers within the dataset.
* Explore relationships between different variables, like how MSRP varies with electric range or the concentration of electric vehicles by city/state.
* Generate insights to guide policies, marketing strategies, and the promotion of electric vehicles based on these variables.

## Data Steps for Analysis:
* Data Cleaning: Address missing or incorrect values and ensure variable consistency.
* Data Manipulation: Format data for ease of analysis, handling both categorical and numerical types.
* Univariate Analysis: Investigate the distribution of each variable to understand overall trends, including the frequency of electric vehicle types and MSRP.
* Bivariate Analysis: Examine the relationships between two variables, such as MSRP versus electric range or city versus CAFV eligibility.

## Conclusion:
The dataset provides valuable insights into the electric vehicle market, highlighting key features like price, range, and CAFV benefits eligibility. Analyzing this data can help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding the electric vehicle industry, policy-making, and potential incentives.
