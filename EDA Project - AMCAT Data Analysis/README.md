Data Description

## Objective of this project :
 The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) that includes both univariate and bivariate analyses. This analysis aims to:
*  Understand the distribution of individual variables (univariate analysis).
*  Identify outliers within the dataset.
*  Explore relationships between different variables (bivariate analysis) to uncover insights related to salary expectations.
*  The analysis involves visualizing the data, identifying trends and patterns, and testing hypotheses to derive meaningful insights.
* These insights can guide decision-making processes and improve salary prediction models.
 
## Data Steps for analyze the dataset:
* Data Cleaning.
* Data Manipulation
* Univariate Analaysis
* Bivariate Analysis

## Conclusion:
The AMCAT dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and educators in the field of educational data mining and skills assessment. By analyzing the employment outcomes of engineering graduates, it provides insights into the effectiveness of various educational methodologies and skill assessments.
